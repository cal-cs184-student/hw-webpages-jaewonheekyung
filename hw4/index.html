		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project, we built a real-time cloth simulation using a mass-spring system to model how cloth moves and collides to objects.
			We constructed data structures to represent the cloth grid, implemented physical constraints between point masses,
			and applied numerical integration to simulate motion over time.<br><br>
		  
			We also handled collisions with external objects like spheres and planes, as well as self-collisions to prevent
			the cloth from passing through itself. To make the simulation visually realistic, we implemented shading techniques using GLSL.<br><br>
		  
			Overall, this project helped us understand both the physics behind cloth behavior and the graphics techniques used to render it.
		</p><br>

			The Cloth::buildGrid() function constructs a physical simulation of a cloth using a point mass-spring system by first generating a 2D grid of PointMass objects and then connecting them with different types of springs.
			Each point mass represents a small segment of cloth and is placed at a position based on the cloth’s orientation (horizontal or vertical), with optional pinning based on predefined coordinates.
			After placing the point masses, the function iterates again to connect each point mass to its neighbors with structural springs (to adjacent points), shearing springs (to diagonal neighbors), and bending springs (to every second neighbor), modeling how real cloth resists stretching, shearing, and bending.
			The algorithm ensures a flexible yet stable network of forces that captures the realistic behavior of fabric under physical constraints.
			This setup provides the foundation for simulating dynamic cloth motion in a physics engine.

		<p>
			<b>Without any shearing constraints</b>, the wireframe looks like a simple grid made of horizontal and vertical lines, forming square cells between the point masses.
			<br><b>With only shearing constraints</b>, the grid loses those straight lines and instead has diagonal connections forming a mesh of triangles, giving it a looser, more flexible appearance.
			<br><b>When all constraints</b> are applied, i.e. structural, shearing, and bending, the wireframe becomes a dense network with horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and longer-range connections, making the cloth look much more reinforced.
			This full setup allows the cloth to resist stretching, shearing, and folding in a more physically accurate way.
		</p><br>
		

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<p>
			In Part 2, we examine how simulation parameters like spring constant ks, density, and damping affect cloth behavior.
			The simulation was paused using P, values adjusted in default, and resumed or restarted with P or R.
		</p>
		<p> Below, we explain how we implmented the logic, and show some comparisons with different parameters. We examine how the cloth behavior changes.</p>
		
		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<h3>(1) Compute Total Force on Each Point Mass</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>First, Reset all forces in the point mass to zero.</li>
			<li>For each external acceleration, compute <code>F = m * a</code> and add to every point mass.</li>
			<li>Then, we loop over all springs:
			<ul>
				<li>Skip disabled constraint types based on <code>cp</code>.</li>
				<li>Apply Hooke's law: <code>F = ks * (||pa - pb|| - l)</code>.</li>
				<li>Reduce <code>ks</code> for bending springs (<code>ks *= 0.2</code>).</li>
				<li>Apply force along the direction vector between point masses.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>(2) Verlet Integration for Position Update</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Compute acceleration: <code>a = force / mass</code>.(we skip pinned point masses)</li>
			<li>Use the formula: <code>new_pos = pos + (1 - d) * (pos - last_pos) + a * delta_t^2</code>.</li>
			<li>Update last_position to the old position.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>(3) Constrain Spring Deformation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For each spring, compute current length, and we want to make constraints for deformation</li>
			<li>We check if the length exceeds a particular amount (length > 1.1 * rest_length):
			<ul>
				<li>Compute direction and correction vector.</li>
				<li>If both point masses are movable, apply half the correction to both.</li>
				<li>If one is pinned, apply the full correction to the movable one. If both are pinned, we skip.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Spring Constant (ks)</h3>
		<p>
			The spring constant <code>ks</code> determines how much the cloth resists stretching. A low value results in a floppy cloth, while a high value makes it stiff and rigid.
			Below, we examine of the spring constant's effect on cloth behavior.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Low (ks = 1):</strong> The cloth is very stretchy and floppy. We could examine that the cloth is lacking structure<br></li>
			<li><strong>High (ks = 100000):</strong> The cloth is very stiff and rigid. Cloth holds shape with minimal deformation.<br></li>
		</ul>
		<table>
			<td style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="./images/ks_low.png" width="400px"/>
				<figcaption>ks = 1</figcaption>
			</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="./images/ks_high.png" width="400px"/>
				<figcaption>ks = 100000</figcaption>
			</td>
		</table>

		<h3>Density</h3>
		<p>
			The density of the cloth affects how quickly it falls and how much it stretches under its own weight. A low density results in a light cloth that flutters easily, while a high density results in a heavy cloth that falls quickly and stretches noticeably under its own weight.
			Below, we examine the effect of density on cloth behavior.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Low (density = 1):</strong> The cloth is light, slow descent, and flutters easily.<br></li>
			<li><strong>High (density = 100):</strong> The cloth is Heavy, falls quickly, and stretches noticeably under weight.<br></li>
		</ul>
		<table>
			<td style="text-align: center;">

			</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="./images/density_high.png" width="400px"/>
				<figcaption>density = 100</figcaption>
			</td>
		</table>

		<h3>Damping</h3>
		<p>
			Damping is a force that opposes motion, simulating air resistance. It affects how quickly the cloth comes to rest after being disturbed. A low damping value results in a cloth that oscillates for a long time before settling, while a high damping value results in a cloth that comes to rest quickly but may appear rigid.
			Below, we examine the effect of damping on cloth behavior.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>No Damping (damping = 0):</strong> The cloth flutters around before resting, oscillating for a long time.<br></li>
			<li><strong>High Damping (damping = 1):</strong> Cloth comes to rest very quickly but moves unnaturally rigid.<br></li>
		</ul>
		<table>
			<td style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="./images/damping_low.png" width="400px"/>
				<figcaption>damping = 0%</figcaption>
			</td>

			The <code>Sphere::collide</code> function checks if a point mass has collided with a sphere and corrects its position if needed.
			<br>(1) First, it computes a vector from the sphere's center to the point mass’s current position and measures the distance.
			<br>(2-i) If the point mass is outside the sphere, it returns early without making changes.
			<br>(2-ii) If the point mass is inside, it normalizes this direction vector, scales it to the sphere’s radius, and adds it to the sphere’s origin to find the tangent point on the surface where the point mass should be.
			<br>(3) Then, it calculates a correction vector from the point mass’s previous position to this tangent point, representing how far it should be pushed to resolve the collision.
			<br>(4) Finally, it updates the point mass’s position by applying the correction vector, scaled by <code>(1 - friction)</code>, to simulate realistic movement and energy loss during the collision.
		</p><br>

		<b>Q. How different the cloths are with different ks constant values?</b>
		<p>
			<b>Low ks (ks = 500):</b> The cloth is very stretchy and floppy. It deforms easily and can be seen to wrap around the sphere.
			<br><b>Medium ks (ks = 5000):</b> The cloth is moderately stiff. It holds its shape well but still has some flexibility.
			<br><b>High ks (ks = 50000):</b> The cloth is very stiff and rigid. It barely deforms and retains its shape even when colliding with the sphere.

		<p>
			The <code>Plane::collide</code> function resolves collisions between a point mass and an infinite plane.
			<br>First, it computes vectors from the plane's reference point to both the point mass's last position and current position, and calculates the dot product of each with the plane's normal vector to determine their relative position.
			<br>If the dot products have opposite signs, this indicates the point mass has crossed the plane between time steps.
			<br>The function then calculates the intersection point (called the tangent point) by projecting the movement direction of the point mass onto the plane.
			<br>It adds a small offset in the normal direction to prevent the point mass from being embedded inside the plane.
			<br>Finally, it computes a correction vector from the last position to the adjusted tangent point and updates the point mass's current position using this vector, scaled by <code>(1 - friction)</code> to simulate the effect of energy loss during the collision.
			<br>Additionally, if the point mass is already slightly beneath the plane, it is nudged above the surface using the surface offset to maintain visual and physical correctness.
		</p><br>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>
			In this section, we implemented a logic to detect and resolve self-collisions within a cloth.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Implementation</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Spatial Hashing: To improve performance and optimization, we implemented a spatial hash map to reduce the number of point mass pairs checked for collisions. We do not have to check for all points which makes a effective method.</li>
			<li>Hash Cell Assignment: Each point mass is assigned to a cell in the hash map based on its position in space. The hash function converts 3D positions into discrete cell IDs to index into the hash table.</li>
			<li>Collision Detection: For each simulation step, a point mass looks up other masses in the same and adjacent cells. This ensures we only check collisions between point masses that are spatially close.</li>
			<li>Collision Resolution: If two masses are closer than the threshold, we compute a correction vector that pushes them apart. We apply these corrections to the two point masses.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Self-Collision Results</h3>
		<p>We show the results of self-collision behavior. The cloth is initialized with one pinned side and allowed to fall over itself.</p>

		<h3>Results based on Parameter Change</h3>

		<h4>Density</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Low density (density = 1):</strong> The cloth is light and falls slowly. I has looser folds that do not press into each other much.</li>
			<li><strong>High density (density = 1000):</strong> The cloth crashes down rapidly and compresses under its own weight. More frequent self-collisions can be seen.</li>

		<h4>Spring Constant (ks)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Low ks (ks = 1):</strong> Soft springs makes easier deformation. Cloth stretches into exaggerated folds and more deeply interpenetrates. A lot of collisions can be seen.</li>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<h3>Q. What is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects?</h3>
		<p>
			<b>A shader program</b> is a set of small programs that run on the GPU to control how 3D graphics appear on the screen.
			It’s usually made up of a vertex shader, which handles the position and transformation of each vertex,
			and a fragment shader, which decides the color and lighting of each pixel.<br><br>
		  
			<b>The vertex shader</b> passes data like normals and UV coordinates to the fragment shader,
			which then uses that information to apply textures and lighting effects.
			For instance, in a texture shader, the <b>fragment shader</b> might sample a texture image
			to determine the color of each pixel.<br>
			Together, these shaders help turn 3D models into realistic, textured images on your screen.

		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model simulates realistic lighting by combining three components: <strong>ambient</strong>, <strong>diffuse</strong>, and <strong>specular</strong> lighting.<br><br>
		  
			<strong>Ambient</strong> light represents constant background illumination:<br>
			<code>vec3 ambient = k_a * I_a;</code><br><br>
		  
			<strong>Diffuse</strong> light models how light scatters off rough surfaces, based on the angle between the surface normal and light direction:<br>
			<code>float diff = max(dot(normal, light_dir), 0.0);</code><br>
			<code>vec3 diffuse = k_d * diff * attenuation * u_color.rgb;</code><br><br>
		  
			<strong>Specular</strong> highlights simulate shiny reflections using the half-vector between the light and view directions:<br>
			<code>vec3 half_vector = normalize(v_dir + light_dir);</code><br>
			<code>float spec = pow(max(dot(normal, half_vector), 0.0), p);</code><br>
			<code>vec3 specular = k_s * attenuation * spec;</code><br><br>
		  
			The final color is the sum of these components, blending soft ambient light, directional diffuse shading, and sharp specular highlights.

		<p>
			For the Texture Mapping, we used our own Oski The Bear texture image. Texture mapping is a technique used to apply a 2D image (texture) onto a 3D surface to give it color and detail.
			In the given GLSL fragment shader, the function <code>texture(u_texture_3, v_uv)</code> samples a color from the
			texture <code>u_texture_3</code> using the UV coordinates <code>v_uv</code>, which are passed in from the vertex shader.
			This sampled color is then assigned to <code>out_color</code>, determining the final color of the fragment.
			The result is that the 2D texture image is wrapped around the 3D model based on its UV layout.

			Bump mapping simulates surface detail by altering how light interacts with the surface,
			without actually changing the shape of the mesh. As seen in the bump-mapped sphere and cloth,
			the surface appears textured and detailed, but the silhouette remains perfectly smooth,
			revealing that the geometry is unchanged.<br><br>
		  
			In contrast, displacement mapping physically modifies the mesh by displacing vertices
			based on a texture map. This creates real surface deformation, which is especially
			noticeable in the displaced cloth where it drapes more naturally, and in the displaced sphere,
			where the shape becomes visibly distorted and matches the texture pattern.<br><br>
		  
			Overall, while bump mapping is cheaper and good for small-scale surface detail,
			displacement mapping provides more realistic depth and shape changes at the cost
			of higher computational complexity.

		<p>
			When the sphere mesh is coarse, i.e. <code>-o 16 -a 16</code>, bump mapping still gives the appearance of surface detail,
			but since it doesn’t modify the mesh geometry, the texture looks smooth and flat when viewed at glancing angles.
			Displacement mapping, on the other hand, struggles at low resolution—because there are fewer vertices to displace,
			the texture appears jagged or blocky and fails to capture fine surface variation.<br><br>
		  
			At higher resolutions, i.e. <code>-o 128 -a 128</code>, the difference becomes much more apparent.
			Bump mapping continues to rely on lighting tricks, and while it looks convincing under good lighting,
			the actual silhouette remains unchanged. In contrast, displacement mapping shines at this resolution—
			with more vertices to manipulate, the geometry is visibly altered, and the surface detail stands out
			even in the silhouette. This makes displacement mapping better for realistic deformations,
			though it comes at a higher computational cost.
